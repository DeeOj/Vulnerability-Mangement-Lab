<h1> Vulnerability Mangement Lab</h1> 

<h2> INTRO </h2>
Today's digital landscape is constantly evolving, the importance of robust cybersecurity measures cannot be overstated. Among these measures, vulnerability management stands out as a critical practice for identifying, assessing, and mitigating security weaknesses within an organization's infrastructure. In this lab, I focus on the application of Nessus Essentials for performing credentialed vulnerability scans against a Windows 10 hosts within a sandbox network environment. 
<br></br>

<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
The primary objective of this vulnerability management lab is to gain practical experience in identifying, prioritizing, assessing, remediating, and verifying security vulnerabilities within systems. 

<h2>PREQUISITES</h2>

- A Computer <br/>
- An Internet Connection

<h2> LINKS </h2>

- [VMWare Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
- [Nessus Essentials](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials)
- [Windows 10 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)


<h2>PROCEDURAL BREAKDOWN</h2>
To set this lab in motion, we need to be able to ping our guest machine from the host. Hence, I will run the 'ipconfig'  on the virtual machine command using CMD, to obtain
its IP address. We see the IPv4 for the machine to be: 192.168.8.128
<br></br>

Let's try to ping the guest machine from the host.

</p>

We see it doesnt work, our request kept timing out. This is because the Firewall on the guest machine is still active at this time. So, for the purpose of this Lab,
I will be turning off the firewall on the virtual machine. 
<br></br>
<b>NB: This act is solely for this project lab, it is best practice to keep your firewall running.</b>
<br><br>

These three profiles are to be turned off:

- Domain Profile
- Private Profile
- Public Profile

</p>

When we ping it again, we see it works. Consequently, Nessus will be able to reach the host when we begin our scan.

<br></br>

<h2>UNAUTHENTICATED SCAN</h2>
Here I am going to perform an unauthenticated scan against the host, and we will see how it compares to an authenticated scan. </br>
So from my host machine, I will login into Nessus, which I am utilizing for this project.
<br></br>

Click 'create a new scan'
<br></br>

<p align="center">

</p>
<br></br>

Select 'Basic Network Scan'
<br></br>

<p align="center">

</p>
<br></br>

Name the system, in my case it's a Windows 10 and insert the IP address in the 'Target' box, then save.
<br></br>

</p>
<br></br>

Once the scan was done, it showed a lot of information to take note of, however for the low and medium severity classifications theres a single vulnerability each.

</p>
<br></br>

<h2>AUTHENTICATED SCAN</h2>
Firstly, I will configure the guest machine to be able to accept aunthenticated scans and provide Nessus with the credentials for the machine, so it can go into the machine,
and have a deeper dive scanning for vulnerabilities.

-Enabling Remote Registry
This will allow the scanner to connect to the computer registry and crawl through the registry and search for insrecure configurations.

Changed the 'Startup type' from Disabled to Automatic, applied and then clicked Ok.

<br></br>

Remote Registry is now running.

- Sharing Settings
  
I am made sure that File and Printer sharing is on.

<br></br>

- Registry Editor (key addition)
The addition of this key will further disable user account control aiding Nessus to connect in during the scan. </br>
The path I will insert this key: "Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
Completing this lab has provided me with invaluable hands-on experience on the process of identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities within a networked environment. By installing and configuring Nessus Essentials, conducting credentialed scans, and remediating the vulnerabilities, I have gained practical insights into the critical steps required to safeguard systems against potential threats.
