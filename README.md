<h1> Vulnerability Mangement Lab</h1> 

<h2> INTRO </h2>
Today's digital landscape is constantly evolving, the importance of robust cybersecurity measures cannot be overstated. Among these measures, vulnerability management stands out as a critical practice for identifying, assessing, and mitigating security weaknesses within an organization's infrastructure. In this lab, I focus on the application of Nessus Essentials for performing credentialed vulnerability scans against a Windows 10 hosts within a sandbox network environment.

<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
The primary objective of this vulnerability management lab is to gain practical experience in identifying, prioritizing, assessing, remediating, and verifying security vulnerabilities within systems. 

<h2>PREQUISITES</h2>

- A Computer <br/>
- An Internet Connection

<h2> LINKS </h2>

- [VMWare Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
- [Nessus Essentials](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials)
- [Windows 10 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
Completing this lab has provided me with invaluable hands-on experience on the process of identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities within a networked environment. By installing and configuring Nessus Essentials, conducting credentialed scans, and remediating the vulnerabilities, I have gained practical insights into the critical steps required to safeguard systems against potential threats.

<h2>PROCEDURAL BREAKDOWN</h2>
For this Lab to even begin we need to be able to ping our guest machine from the host. Hence, I will run the 'ipconfig'  on the virtual machine command using CMD, to obtain
its IP address.

Let's try to ping the guest machine from the host.

((PIC))

We see it doesnt work, this is because the Firewall on the guest machine is still active at this time. 

((PIC))

So, for the purpose of this Lab, I will be turning off the firewall
on the virtual machine. 
<b>NB: This act is solely for this project lab, it is best practice to keep your firewall running.</b>

When we ping it again, we see it works. Consequently, Nessus will be able to reach the Host when we begin our scan.
